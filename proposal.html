            <h3>Topic Overview</h3>
            <p>
                The NBA has a vast fan base seeking platforms to express opinions, connect with other enthusiasts, and stay updated with their favorite teams and players. However, there is a lack of centralized and interactive platforms that cater to these needs comprehensively.
            </p>

            <h3>Identify Information Technology Problem</h3>
            <p>
                The primary information technology problem is the absence of a user-centric, interactive platform for NBA fans. Existing solutions like the NBA's official app and Reddit's NBA subreddit offer partial solutions but lack personalization and interactive elements that enhance fan engagement.

            <h3>Identify Existing Attempts</h3>
            <section>
                <h4><a href="https://www.nba.com/">NBA's Official App</a></h4>
                <p>
                    Provides news, scores, and video highlights but lacks interactive features like fan forums and prediction tracking.
                </p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/?rdt=35170">Reddit's NBA Subreddit</a></h4>
                <p>
                    Offers a platform for discussion but lacks personalization and official integration with NBA data.
